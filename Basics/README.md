### [Working with Numbers](https://github.com/ehime/python-primers/blob/master/Basics/001-numerical.py)

Python provides arithmetic operations for manipulating numbers to a straightforward manner that is similar to that used in other programming languages.
the following example assigns numbers to two variables and computes their product:

    >>> x = 3
    >>> y = 7
    >>> x * y
    28

The following examples demonstrate other arithmetic operations involving integers:

    >>> 2+2
    4
    >>> 4/3
    1
    >>> 3-8
    -5
